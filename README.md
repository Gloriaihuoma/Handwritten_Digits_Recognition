### CNN Handwritten Recognition

#### Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten characters. The goal is to accurately classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a common benchmark in machine learning for handwritten digit recognition.

#### Installation
To run this notebook, you need Python installed on your machine. The required Python libraries include:

Jupyter Notebook
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib

#### Data Source
The MNIST dataset, containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), is often used. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale representation of a digit.

#### Loading the Data
The MNIST dataset can be loaded directly from their respective dataset collections using libraries like TensorFlow or Keras.
